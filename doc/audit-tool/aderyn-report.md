# High Issues

## H-1: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function

> Acknowledge

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

> Acknowledge

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```solidity

	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

> Version is set in the config file

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-3: PUSH0 Opcode

> Acknowledge

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
